- Hierarchically structured mental representations
- Explicit mappings between layers of the representation
- The use of recurring basic patterns for knowledge representation
- Well-connected representation enhancing understanding of how parts of the program interact
- Representations well-grounded in the program text enhancing the localisation of structures and operations","Experimental task
- Reading a 135 line Pascal program.
- Answering questions that investigate the five abstract characteristics.
- The questions ask the participant to, e.g. match procedure names to the procedures they call, listing procedure names, writing descriptions of goals (of procedures and entire program), labelling code segments, listing names used for the same data objects in different program units, listing important variable names, filling in names of program units in a program outline, matching variable names to procedures where they occur, and indicating physical location of invariant program parts.
